This project explores the fascinating relationship between sunspots and solar flares, two key phenomena in space weather. By investigating patterns in sunspot activity and their correlation with solar flare occurrences over the years, the analysis aims to deepen understanding and enable predictions of these events.

Objectives:
Analyse historical data on sunspots and solar flares.
Identify and visualise patterns and relationships between these phenomena.
Use insights from the data to predict flare occurrences based on sunspot trends.

Tools and Technologies:
The project utilises a combination of data visualisation and analysis tools:

- Power BI: For intuitive and interactive visualizations.
- Python Libraries: Including Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualisation, and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

Summary:
Through this project, I aim to shed light on the interplay between sunspots and solar flares, offering insights into their patterns and contributing to the broader understanding of space weather dynamics.

Feel free to explore the code and visualisations in this repository, and reach out with any questions or suggestions!
